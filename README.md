# McKibben force

(By the way, for some fricking reason, the code closes when it executes on python and I have no idea why, so try to run the code on the python itself or on Spyder "(Python 3.9)" program, lol)

This is a code made by OpenAI Chat that calculates the force generated by a McKibben Artificial muscle. I did not make this code.

Basically, I foudn the equation on this link: https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/239231/what-should-be-the-dimensions-and-pressure-used-in-the-5-ton-hydraulic-mckibben

But it was too annoying to have to write almost a disertion every time I needed to check a value for my project: https://hackaday.io/project/188391-diy-human-sized-mech

So I asked the openai to make a code where I just need to insert the values of "S", "N", "P" and "θ" (which are explained bellow).

You can make yourself the equation on a scientific calculator with the following equation:

The equation required to calculate the force generated by a McKibben muscle in a scientific calculator in "degree mode" or "deg" is:

F=Pπr^20(3(cot^2θ)(1−kϵ)2−csc^2θ).

"F" means "force in newtons";

"π" is the Pi value;

"r" is the result of the equation "(S/(2πN))sin0";

"S" is the length of the filaments in the braided sleeve cylinder in mm;

"N" is the amount of times these filaments wrap around this braided sleeve cylinder;

"θ" is the angle in which these filaments are in this braided sleeve cylinder;

"sin" is the sine of a given number in a scientific calculator;

"cot^2θ" is the result of the equation "((tan(θ))^-1)^2";

"tan" is the tangent function on a scientific calculator, or just tan, the tangent of a given number;

"ϵ" is "0.05";

"k" is "1.30";

"csc^2θ" is the result of equation "((sin(θ))^-1)²";

"P" is the pressure value in kPa;
